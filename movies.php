			<p> Harry Potter is an
				orphaned boy brought up by his unkind Muggle (non-magical) aunt and uncle. At the age of eleven,
				half-giant Rubeus Hagrid informs him that he is actually a wizard and that his parents were murdered by
				an evil wizard named Lord Voldemort. Voldemort also attempted to kill one-year-old Harry on the same
				night, but his killing curse mysteriously rebounded and reduced him to a weak and helpless form. Harry
				became extremely famous in the Wizarding World as a result. Harry begins his first year at Hogwarts
				School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and learns about magic. During the year, Harry and his friends Ron
				Weasley and Hermione Granger become entangled in the mystery of the Philosopher's Stone which is being
				kept within the school.</p>

				Chamber), learn that he can speak Parseltongue, and also discover the properties of a mysterious diary,

				against each other. However, curiously, Harry's name is also produced from the Goblet thus making him a
				fourth champion, which results in a terrifying encounter with a reborn Lord Voldemort.</p>

				annotated school textbook, inscribed 'This is the property of the Half-Blood Prince'. Draco Malfoy
				struggles to carry out a deed presented to him by Voldemort. Meanwhile, Dumbledore and Harry secretly
				work together to discover the method on how to destroy the Dark Lord once and for all.</p>
